🔍 Detection of Sub-surface Defects from Thermal Images
📌 Overview
Sub-surface defects such as cracks, voids, delaminations, and corrosion spots are often hidden beneath a material's surface and can compromise the structural strength of components in industries such as aerospace, automotive, civil infrastructure, and manufacturing.
While traditional inspection methods like ultrasonic testing and visual inspection have their advantages, they are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes ineffective for early-stage defect detection.

Thermal imaging provides a non-contact, non-destructive, and rapid inspection technique, where temperature variations reveal material inconsistencies. However, manual inspection of thermal images is prone to human error, especially when contrast is low or defects are small.

This project introduces an automated computer vision approach to detect and highlight sub-surface defects from thermal infrared images using OpenCV-based edge detection and contour extraction techniques.

🚩 Problem Statement
Structural defects hidden beneath the surface are difficult to identify without specialized techniques.

Manual inspection is subjective and varies with operator experience.

Small defects in low-resolution or noisy thermal images may go undetected.

There is a need for an automated, reliable, and fast detection system to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs.

🎯 Objectives
Develop an automated pipeline for detecting sub-surface defects in thermal infrared images.

Improve edge clarity while preserving fine defect boundaries.

Reduce false positives through noise suppression and morphological filtering.

Present detection results in a clear, visual format for easy interpretation.

💡 Proposed Solution
We present an edge-based image processing framework with the following features:

Grayscale conversion to simplify data representation.

Bilateral filtering for denoising while preserving sharp defect boundaries.

Canny edge detection for accurate crack boundary extraction.

Morphological closing to connect broken edges.

Contour detection and overlay for final defect visualization.

Multi-view visualization showing intermediate and final results in a tabular layout.

⚙️ Methodology
Step 1 – Image Acquisition
Input: Infrared (IR) thermal images captured using a FLIR camera or equivalent thermal imaging device.

Format: .jpg or .png

Step 2 – Preprocessing
Convert RGB to grayscale for simplified processing.

Apply bilateral filtering (cv2.bilateralFilter) to remove noise while maintaining edges.

Step 3 – Edge Detection
Use Canny edge detection with optimized thresholds (40 and 120) to capture fine cracks and structural defects.

Step 4 – Morphological Filtering
Apply morphological closing (cv2.MORPH_CLOSE) with a 3×3 kernel to fill small gaps in detected edges.

Step 5 – Contour Extraction
Identify continuous boundaries of defects using cv2.findContours.

Overlay contours in red on the grayscale image for defect marking.

Step 6 – Visualization
Present results in a 2×2 table layout:
